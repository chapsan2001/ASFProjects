# Android Studio Flutter Projects
In 2020 I have started studying Flutter and Dart. Thanks Google that Dart is similar to Java.

My first project is "My First Calculator", not really genious name, huh? I have done it as a project for DotGov Solutions internship. It can count simple math functions and convert numbers between different number systems.
